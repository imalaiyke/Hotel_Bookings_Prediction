### 📘 Additional Information:

#### 🏢 **Context:**
A significant number of hotel bookings are canceled due to various reasons such as changes in plans or scheduling conflicts. The option for free or low-cost cancellation is beneficial for hotel guests but results in revenue loss for hotels. Last-minute cancellations exacerbate this issue, leading to higher losses. 🚪🛏️

The rise of online booking channels has altered customer behavior, adding complexity to how hotels manage cancellations. This change challenges traditional booking models and guest characteristics. 💻📱

#### 💡 **Impact of Cancellations:**
- 🏨 **Loss of resources:** Revenue loss when rooms can't be resold.
- 🌐 **Additional costs:** Increased distribution channel costs, such as higher commissions or promotional efforts.
- 💸 **Lower profit margins:** Last-minute price drops to resell rooms reduce profit margins.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Human resources strain:** More effort required to handle guest arrangements.

#### 🎯 **Objective:**
The increasing number of cancellations calls for a Machine Learning-based solution to predict which bookings are likely to be canceled. INN Hotels Group, a chain in Portugal, has requested your firm to provide a data-driven solution. As a data scientist, your task is to:
1. 🔍 Analyze the provided data to determine which factors significantly impact booking cancellations.
2. 🤖 Build a predictive model that can forecast cancellations in advance.
3. 💼 Help create policies that mitigate cancellations and maximize hotel revenue.
